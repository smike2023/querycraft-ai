git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: QueryCraft AI with 8 tools"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/querycraft-ai.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

### Option 2: Download and Push from Your Computer

1. **Download the project**
   - Download the entire `/workspace/querycraft-ai/` folder
   - Save it somewhere on your computer

2. **Follow the instructions in GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md**
   - It's written super simply, step-by-step
   - Includes solutions to common problems

## 🔑 Important: Before You Push

### 1. Create Your GitHub Repository
- Go to github.com
- Click "+" → "New repository"
- Name: `querycraft-ai`
- Description: `Professional MongoDB Development Platform with AI-Powered Features`
- Public repository
- **DON'T** add README, .gitignore, or license (we have them!)

### 2. Get a Personal Access Token
You'll need this instead of your password:
1. GitHub.com → Profile picture → Settings
2. Developer settings (bottom of page)
3. Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
4. Generate new token → Check "repo"
5. Copy the token (you can't see it again!)

### 3. Update README After Pushing
Once on GitHub, replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in README.md with your actual username (appears in 3 places)

---

## 📝 What to Update in README.md

Search for `YOUR_USERNAME` and replace with your GitHub username in these sections:
1. Clone command
2. Repository links
3. Issues/Discussions links

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Read These First:
1. **GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Complete instructions
2. **README.md** - See how your project will look
3. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - How others can help

### Common Issues:
- "Permission denied" → Use personal access token, not password
- "Remote already exists" → Run: `git remote remove origin` first
- "Nothing to commit" → Make sure you're in the right folder

---

## 📦 What's NOT Included (On Purpose!)

These are intentionally excluded via .gitignore:
- ❌ `node_modules/` (too large, can be reinstalled)
- ❌ `.env` (contains secrets, never commit!)
- ❌ `dist/` (build output, regenerated)
- ❌ `.pnpm-store/` (package manager cache)

Everyone who clones your repo will run `pnpm install` to get these.
